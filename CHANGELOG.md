### Afterword
I think I managed to make a good Nier: Automata UI theme, although the work is far from complete.
Some elements could not be changed due to IDE itself, such as GIT branch, the panel with typos, and so on. I hope to find a solution to this problem.

If you liked my theme, don't forget to put a rating and write a review in JetBrains marketplace.
